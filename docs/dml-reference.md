# DML Reference

This document is just the beginning of what should become a complete reference
to the DML language.

Currently, it contains only a few elements (the new ones that are being added
to the language).

## Entity type names

### Package declarations

Using the keyword "package" it is possible to define a common prefix for all
the entity-type names that appear after that declaration.  After a package
declaration such as

    package some.qualified.id;

all the _relative_ entity type names will be prefixed with
"some.qualified.id.".

For instance, the following class declarations are interpreted as shown
(assuming no previous package declaration):

    class name;           =>   class some.qualified.id.name;
    class another.name;   =>   class some.qualified.id.another.name;

A package declaration remains in effect until another package declaration is
found.

An empty package declaration is written as:

    package;

and its effect is to make all the following entity type names as absolute.


### Absolute entity type names

When a package declaration is in effect, it is still possible to use an
_absolute_ entity-type name, by starting the name with a ".".  The name of the
entity-type, however, will not have the dot, as shown below:

    package foo;

    class bar;        =>   class foo.bar;
    class baz.quux;   =>   class foo.baz.quux;
    class .abs.name;  =>   class abs.name;


## Value types

The slots of an entity type must always be of a certain value-type.

But, even though there are a few value-types built into the DML, typically,
each domain model will use a different set of value-types.

So, in the DML it is possible to declare new value-types (only the declaration
that the type exists, rather than its definition, which is, at least for now,
out of the scope of the DML).

There are two possible value-type declarations: one for enums and another one
for other kinds of value-types.  In the first case, the externalization of the
values of the value-type are handled automatically by the DML compiler.  In
the latter case, it must be specified in the value-type declaration how should
the values of that type be externalized.

The syntax for enums is the following:

    enum value-type-fully-qualified-name  [ as alias-identifier ] ;


The syntax for non-enum value-types, however, is this:

    valueType value-type-fully-qualified-name [ as alias-identifier ] {
       <externalization-clause>
       [ <internalization-clause> ]
    }

where \<externalization-clause\> must be present and has the following form:

    externalizeWith {
      valueType1 methodName1();
      valueType2 methodName2();
      ...
    }

For ease of reference in the text that follows, we will call each of the
"valueType methodName();" declarations that appears within the
externalization-clause block delimited by braces an "externalization element".

The value-type of an externalization element must have been previously
declared as a valid value-type (and, therefore, it cannot be the same
value-type of the current value-type declaration).  Note, also, that this
restriction prevents cycles in the externalization relations.

The semantics of an externalization-clause for a value-type VT is that a value
of VT should be externalized as a series of one or more values of other (more
primitive) value-types, in the order specified by the externalization elements
within the externalization-clause.  Each externalization element describes the
type of one of those values and what method should be called to get the
externalization value.

The current code generator assumes that if the method name of an
externalization element contains a dot, then it is a static method with a
single argument type assignable to a value of the value-type VT.  Otherwise,
it is a no-argument method of the class implementing the value-type.

Unlike the \<externalization-clause\>, the \<internalization-clause\> is
optional.  If no \<internalization-clause\> is specified, a value is
reconstructed by calling the constructor of the value-type with the values
corresponding to the external representation of the value, in the same order
as they were specified in the \<externalization-clause\>.

If, however, an \<internalization-clause\> is specified, it must have the
following form:

    internalizeWith methodName();

In this case, the method called "methodName" should be used to reconstruct a
value of the value-type VT.

For instance, to externalize a java.math.BigDecimal as a String we may use
this:

    valueType java.math.BigDecimal {
      externalizeWith {
        String toString();
      }
    }

because the java.math.BigDecimal.toString() method creates an external
representation of the BigDecimal that may be used to reconstruct the
BigDecimal value again with

    new BigDecimal(external-representation-as-string)

If, on the other hand, we have a class that has no pair getter/constructor
that allows us to do this, such as the java.util.Currency class, but that has
a static method that allows us to reconstruct a value of the class, then we
may write it like this:

    valueType java.util.Currency {
      externalizeWith {
        String toString();
      }

     internalizeWith getInstance();
    }

Also, besides these simple cases where a given value is externalized as
another single value, it is possible to have value-types that may be
externalized as more than one value.  For instance, consider the case of a
Money value-type that represents a given amount on some currency.  If the
amount and currency are sufficient to completely describe a value of Money,
and assuming the appropriate methods and constructor on the Money class, we
may use this in the DML specification:

    valueType Money {
      externalizeWith {
        long getAmount();
        Currency getCurrency();
      }
    }


Finally, if a given value-type is implemented by a class that does not provide
either a method to create an external representation of it, nor a method to
reconstruct it from the external representation, we may still create static
methods in some other class and use those methods in the externalization and
internalization clauses.  For instance, assume that we want to externalize a
Money as a String in the form "amount currency", and that there is no
appropriate methods in class Money.  The skeleton of a possible solution is
the following:

    class MoneyExternalization {
      public static String moneyAsString(Money money) {
        return String.valueOf(money.getAmount()) + " " + money.getCurrency().toString();
      }

     public static Money moneyFromString(String moneyExtRep) {
       String[] parts = moneyExtRep.split(" ", 2);
       long amount = Long.parseLong(parts[0]);
       Currency currency = Currency.getInstance(parts[1]);
       return new Money(amount, currency);
      }
    }

    valueType Money {
      externalizeWith {
        String MoneyExternalization.moneyAsString();
      }

     internalizeWith MoneyExternalization.moneyFromString();
    }
   
### Parametric value-types

It is possible to use parametric value-types in the DML, both when declaring
that a value-type exists (in a value-type declaration), and when specifying
the properties of an entity-type.

For instance, given a value-type declaration such as this:

    valueType my.package.MyType as MyType {
      ...
    }

it is possible to use this in an entity-type declaration as shown below:

    class MyEntity {
      MyType<A,B> prop1;
    }


It is also possible, though, to declare the parametric type in the value-type
declaration:

    valueType my.package.MyType<A,B> as MyType {
      ...
    }

and then use it like this:

    class MyEntity {
      MyType prop1;
    }

The result in this case will be the same as above.

This is useful when MyType is most often used with the type parameters A and
B, even if in some cases it may be changed.  For instance, given the last
declaration for MyType, it is still possible to use like this:

    class MyEntity {
      MyType prop1;
      MyType<X,Y> prop2;
      MyType<Z,W<C,F>> prop3;
    }

The Java class generated for MyEntity will have three properties, prop1 to
prop3, with the following types:

    my.package.MyType<A,B>
    my.package.MyType<X,Y>
    my.package.MyType<Z,W<C,F>>


### Restrictions imposed of value types 

As the name implies, value-types must be immutable.  Actually, the backing
implementation of a value type may be that of a mutable class.  However, in
such cases the programmer must take care not to change the contents of the
value types created, so that they behave as immutable.  The typical approach
when 'changing a slot typed with a value type that is actually mutable' is to
create a new value type instance, rather than to change the existing instance,
which would lead to incorrect behaviour of this framework.

Should a programmer decide to create a value type that can internally hold an
[Entity][Entity type names], the programmer should invoke that entity's
externalization mechanism when externalizing the value type.  This is to
ensure that no automatic serialization occurs on entities, which could be the
case if the externalization of a value type simply returned an object that
actually contained a reference to an entity.

## Indexes Module

This module allows indexing domain objects in a relation efficiently. These are implemented using only components internal to the framework. Namely, it relies on internal backend-independent collections to maintain the indexes persistently and for fast querying using automatically generated methods.


### What to do in the DML file?

DML accepts an indexed attribute in each relation. This way, creating an indexed relation boils down to:

<pre>
class Person {}

class Address {
    String country;
}

relation PersonHasAddresses {
    Person playsRole owner;
    Address playsRole address {
        multiplicity 0..*;
        indexed by country;
    }
}
</pre>

The attribute that instructs the framework to create the index is the 'indexed' keyword. This means that each Person has at most one Address with a given country. If the index is deemed not to be unique, then the it must be declared in the following way: indexed by country #(*);


### Compilation Step

After enhancing the application's DML files with indexed relations you must recompile the application so that the newly generated domain classes (the *_Base.java ones) are upgraded with index search methods.

### Changing the application code

For each indexed relation, the previous step generates a new getter in the relation that receives as argument a possible value for the index, and returns the corresponding object(s) of the relation that have that value. The convention used is that the search by index queries are provided in methods:

    TypeOfDomainClassIndexed get<RelationName>By<SlotNameOfIndexedObject>(TypeOfSlotOfIndexedObject)

This means that the search methods receive an argument of the type of the attribute that we are using for the index. Moreover, the return is of the type of the domain class in the "-to-many" side of the relation.
Whenever the index is not unique (stated by an arbitrary cardinality in the DML file), the result is instead a Set.

Using the example presented above, it would generate code as follows:

    public class Person_Base {
        (...)
        public Address getAddressByCountry(String country) 
        (...)
    }


This allows an efficient search for a given Address. The typical usage is to refactor code similar to the following:

    Person john  = (...) // get John
    for (Address addr : john.getAddress()) {
        if (addr.getCountry().equals("Portugal")) {
            john.payTaxes(addr);
            return;
        }
    }


...into:

    Person john  = (...) // get John
    john.payTaxes(john.getAddressByCountry("Portugal"));
    

Not only the code becomes clearer, but also the implementation of the index is such that it performs better than the naive iterations/search.

### Design

The design of these indexes explores the DML based collections in the framework. These collections export a key-value API and are used to store the objects of relations "-to-many". For instance, the above example would have a collection holding John's addresses. To efficiently fetch an address with a given country, we use as keys in that relation the country of the addresses. This means that an indexed relation poses no overheads at all.

On the other hand, if the relation is indexed using an attribute that is not unique, then we batch the objects that collide in the index key. These batches use a collection, meaning that the collection of the relation actually holds several collections. This is decided statically upon compilation of the application, meaning that no runtime checks are performed, and the normal case of unique indexation is as efficient as we can get.


## Pluggable Collections

The framework also allows parametrizing which collection is used internally in relations between Domain Objects. Three seperate modules can be found with regard to a B+Tree, a Linked List and a Skip List.

### The importance of collections

Pluggable collections are built on top of DML. This means that they are backend independent and automatically persisted. As a matter of fact, they can be used within the application for that purpose, although most uses should be relying on modelling with DML and relations between entities.

But besides that point, the actual importance of collections (namely, the abstraction of a set), is that it is used internally by the framework to model relations one-to-many between Domain Entities. Without going into further detail, this means that when a Person is declared in DML to have 0 or more Posts in a relation, this will automatically generate code that resorts to a DML, backend-independent collection to contain the Posts that the Person owns.

Therefore it makes sense to allow configuration of the collection to match different workloads. For instance, it can be that a very small relation takes more advantage of a Linked List, moreso if most of the accesses are insertions or removals. On the other hand, a very large relation with many queries can benefit more from a B+Tree. At the moment the configuration allows only to state a collection for the whole application, but this may be addressed in the near-future.

### How to configure

The parametrization is set through the pom.xml as many other parameters. An example follows:


    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>pt.ist</groupId>
                <artifactId>dml-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
                <configuration>
                    <codeGeneratorClassName>${fenixframework.code.generator}</codeGeneratorClassName>
                    <params>
                        <collectionClassName>pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.bplustree.BPlusTree</collectionClassName>
                    </params>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>generate-domain</goal>
                            <goal>post-compile</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>



Note the single line within the 'configuration' tag:
    <collectionClassName>pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.bplustree.BPlusTree</collectionClassName>

### Possible configurations

Note that to use a specific collection, the dependency on the corresponding module must be estabilished in the pom.xml. This means that if one configures the collection to be the Linked-List, then it must add the dependency to the linked-list module.

The following collections are available with the corresponding modules:
* B+Tree - pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.bplustree.BPlusTree - bplus-tree-domain-object
* B+Tree improved in terms of performance - pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.bplustree.BPlusTreeArray - bplus-tree-domain-object
* Skip-List - pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.skiplist.SkipList - skip-list-domain-object
* Linked-List - pt.ist.fenixframework.core.adt.linkedlist.LinkedList - linked-list-domain-object

Each backend (and its respecive code generator) has a default collection which it uses if no configuration is given. It is the case that all transactional backends are using the B+Tree as the default collection.
