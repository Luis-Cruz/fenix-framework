    1. Synchronized on local commit lock? not needed assuming that:

    - there is a single global commit lock

    - commit clears the remote commits queue (synchronized on the
    REMOTE_COMMITS)
        
    So, while a commit is writing back, it is not possible for elements to
    appear in REMOTE_COMMITS (due to the global lock), and thus transactions
    that are starting will surely not be trying to update any vboxes due
    to finding anything in the queue to process
        
    2. Synchronized in each vbox is needed, because it's possible that some
    other tx (ongoing or commiting may need to reload it, while a starting tx
    is running this method.
    
    3. need to apply local commits as well, or remote only?  Need to apply all,
    because of this: on node A tx 1 is committing.  After committing to repository
    but before updating local activeRecord it takes a break.  Now, another node
    B runs a read tx 2 that happens to see values committed by tx 1 to the
    repository (by reloading them. no prob here).  Now, after committing tx2,
    the same client of tx 2 runs another tx 3 on node A.  This tx will need to
    update the stuff that the halted commit is yet to do, so that it can ensure
    that the client does not see things from the past (the tx would start on
    an older version).

    Actually, this means that I may be able to release the commit lock earlier,
    by not applying the write set within the commit lock, but by doing so only
    in applyRemoteCommit (regardless of whether its really remote!) :-)
    
    However, do I need to advance the activeRecord in the commit? If not, I can
    just wait for another starting transaction to do it...hmmm dangerous...  if
    I do need to update the activeRecord in the commit lock then this method
    also needs to get the commit lock to update that record... which comes back
    to whether we need the commit lock from the beginning.

    Playing it on the safe side I may as well just get the commit lock to
    start with... then re-evaluate its need as an optimization.
