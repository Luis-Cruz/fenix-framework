     The validation for local transactions follows the usual protocol: (1)
    helpCommitAll, (2) snapshotValidation, and (3) validateAndEnqueue.  The
    difference is that now others may also be helping with the validation. So:

    - initially, check if validation already completed.  This is also useful to
    avoid starting the validation when there is only one (already validated)
    entry in the commit requests queue, and we're just waiting for more requests
    to arrive.

    - snapshot validation is a helped phase (split into buckets).  if it fails
    the request is marked as failed.  however, care must be taken to check that
    if a read vbox already contains a more recent entry, such entry may belong
    to this transaction already! (someone else helped quite a lot!).  In that
    case, the whole commit for this transaction is done! :-)  As usual, a more
    recent write by another to a VBox that was read, will cause validation to
    fail.
    
    - validateCommitAndEnqueue only needs to be attempted once.  Given that
    snapshotValidation passed, then if enqueue fails it's because someone else
    did it already.  Moving along...
